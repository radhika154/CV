<h1> SOCIAL MEDIA DURING 2020 </h1>
<h5> The biggest revolution in the history of communication is Social Media and this started a completely new era altogether. Every platform that enables us to communicate and socialise locally and globally is a Social media platform. Social Media has expanded the horizons of communication more than ever and has changed the pace of life forever. How many followers do you have on Instagram? Did you check her WhatsApp status? Why does he not like my pictures on Facebook? Well, these are some conversations friends usually have. Social Media now is not just a way of communication anymore, for some it's a way of life.
It has started to govern everything, from what we wear to what we eat from what we buy to where we go. In order to look “cool”, millennials and gen-z’s now are living in the virtual world just to keep up. Most people are of the opinion that social media has brought down and destroyed every iota of physical human interaction at a very alarming rate. In fact, in their opinion social media is pretty much everything wrong with the world right now. There are a lot of others with the opinion that social media has helped, improved and given us better options and ways of staying connected to those we love wherever they are in the world. But social media is more than just all that now…
<p>
  Despite it being a host of negativity, social media is still very important for society as a whole due to a large number of benefits it is associated with. A person grows more socially informed of the matters of the world. With the rise of social media, the LGBTQIA community was able to find different ways to use this as an outlet. A lot of people who haven’t come out to their family members find solace and comfort on social media. The #LoveWins movement which made same sex marriage legal across all states isnt the only movement that has trended on social media.The Black Lives Matter movement, with #blackouttuesday was trending on all social media platforms with around 2 crore 16 lakh posts just on instagram. The #MeToo movement has had a significant effect throughout many industries, highlighting the commonness of sexual harassment in society. Social media has given voice to issues like feminism, condemning toxic masculinity and rape culture and adressing issues like global warming and climate change. People as the millennials call it are getting “woke”. The speciality of social media is that even though it is a common ground for people from all over the world, it is still different for each and every one of us. For some social media is a way to stay connected to their loved ones, for some it's their source of livelihood, for some it's a way of coming out with their life stories and for some it's just a teenage whim. It further provides a platform for young aspiring artists to showcase their skills. You can perceive great possibilities for a job through social media too. Social media is now a hub for different companies to promote their trademarks. The virtual world undoubtedly is polluted by the growing toxicity among the users in the form of trolling, people are resisting social media. But just like we can't blame earth for global warming, we cannot blame the social media platforms for hate. In short, certainly social media has both gains and losses. But, it all depends on the user at the end. </h5>

<h1> PRIDE AT IT’S BEST </h1>
<h5> The Pride month is celebrated in June because Stonewall riots in New York that literally sparked the LGBTQIA+ movement happened in the month of June, but let's just forget the genesis of it all.
What  is homosexuality, is it a disease, is it a mental problem, is it wrong. None of this. It’s just not socially accepted.
Being a sociology student, I can't help but think about this with a sociological perspective. Society now is not just a form of consciousness for humans. It is a form of fear. It creates pressure for us to be civil and, as long as someone adheres to this form of living everybody is happy and content, and so far this form of living ensures a peaceful life with a consistent future on god's green earth. But this is a big world. Huge. with a population of 7.9 billion people. And why in the world should we burden all these people to be the same.
<p>
  According to a study, every person meets about 10,000 people in their lifespan. Is it fair to expect all of them to be the same? No right, that's absurd. Now, think about the people closest to you. They are familiar and suddenly they are not. Why? Not because they fell in love with the wrong person, but with the wrong gender. We don't accept them because we think that it might ruin our social status, but what if we forget about it, just for a second and what if we love them for who they are, for their courage to accept difference in a hippocratic world that changes every second but claims a thousand year old culture and what if everybody does this? The energy that will flow because of love might actually cure us from our mental pandemic, i.e hate!
</p>
<p>
  We are all afraid of change, because we think that it might ruin what civilizations have built over the years . It might ruin our legacy, but what good is all of this, if in this abundant world, we don't get to be ourselves. We are born in this world but what is the use of life if we don't grow. History has it that there was, is and always will be another way to look at things because, ”Different isn't bad, it's just not the same.”
  So where does India stand in terms of LGBTQIA+. Just in case you didnt check your calender its 2021, and yet homophobia, transphobia and other gender related phobias are still a thing,and after years of struggle and hardship, India on 8th september, 2018 made a landmark ruling that homosexuality under section 377 is unconstitutional, thus decriminalizing gay sex. But the shortcoming of this was that it didnt legalize same sex marriage. This happened in 2018. Imagine people over the years, nay, centuries living in secret, fear, pressure, displeased with life and themselves just because they were different. The worst part is that the hate is still alive within some of us. They say that this generation will do better, but are we really giving justice to this statement? Let's look within ourselves and check whether we are accepting the inevitable change that time has offered since The Big Bang.
</p>
We live in a world where it is far too easy for creators to mock, roast and make fun of those people which somehow makes them look “cool”. The advancement of technology is the change of this time period, so why not use it to spread love.
Accept men who are a little feminine and women who are a little masculine. Accept love with open arms, be that from anyone for anyone. Lets not let a person's biological aspect define him or her or they as an individual. Lets not call hyperfeminine women dumb and lets not judge men for crying. Lets not live in a world where people are mocked and subjected to violence for being themselves.
This generation of Millennials, Gen-Zs and Gen Alphas should be different to accept differences.
We need to appreciate these “masculine gals”, “ girly boys” and “non- binary pals” for their vulnerability, compassion, understanding and love, qualities that are much needed in a society that too often fails to reward these special traits.
</h5>

<h1>  DIVERSITY  </h1>

<h5> Diversity is the art of thinking independently together. This very moment is talking about diversity. It essentially means having a range of people with various racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds and various lifestyles, experience, and interests coming together. Technology might connect us as a global village but the essence of that connection lies in the acceptance of differences. Diversity in its essence means respect and acceptance. It is a whole another perspective about the world outside our little world. Diversity in its many forms inculcates empathy in us.
<p>
  Society now is not just a form of consciousness for humans. It is a form of fear. It creates pressure for us to be civil and, as long as someone adheres to this form of living everybody is happy and content, and so far this form of living ensures a peaceful life with a consistent future on god's green earth. But is everybody happy and content? This is a big world. Huge. with a population of 7.9 billion people. And why in the world should we burden all these people to be the same.
</p>
<p>
  Culture is a way of life. An individual's culture is unknowingly influenced by many factors that filter a person’s mindset throughout their life. Ignorant of these aspects of our backgrounds, the world still faces issues like communalism and fundamentalism. Diversity is nothing without acceptance, and I repeat it is NOTHING without acceptance. The beauty of the world lies in the diversity of people. THE LOVE THAT’LL FLOW BECAUSE OF ACCEPTANCE OF DIVERSITY MIGHT ACTUALLY CURE US FROM OUR MENTAL PANDEMIC, THAT IS HATE.
</p>
The identity of India is diversity. People from all walks of life live here.
Even if we ignore the scruffy political matters, we as people will face a problem in the near future if we don't accept the change that time has offered since the big bang. Lastly, I would like to say this generation of Millennials, Gen-Zs and Gen Alphas should be different to accept differences.</h5>

<h1> ELEMENTS I LIKE ABOUT STUDYING SHAKESPEARE </h1>

<h5> Only active as a writer for a quarter century, he wrote thirty-eight plays, one hundred fifty-four sonnets and two epic poems, that reinvented and defined the English language to such a degree, that his works require study, all over the world. Willam Shakespeare needs no introduction, but introducing Shakespeare to young minds, can be a tough row to hoe. The overt fear towards this form of heavy literature has grown so much that people almost always forget the power it holds in shaping young minds. But let's just take a moment and forget the genesis of it all. Studying Shakespeare is more than just acing in tests. Reading Shakespeare shouldn't just be about the academics, it should be about perspective, passion, love, envy, hate, and majorly the drama. When I first read Shakespeare's play Macbeth, I wasn't able to understand the depth of his character. When I read the plot further all I could think of is how much I wanted to fix his clearly deceased brain. But, the more the story matured the more I could understand why Macbeth's character took a dark turn. The bard of avon in one of his most celebrated works explored his character’s inner conflicts, guilt and remorse. Something that all of us in today's world are struggling with. I was in awe of the realistic aspect of that play. Read the news on any given day and we will find people struggling with the same issues that the characters in Macbeth struggled with. Why do we read novels and books and stories? Some people read them for knowledge and some read because it's an escape for them. Reading makes them feel a little less alone and a little more free. They read to relate. And that is so fascinating about Shakespeare's plays, because however ancient they might be, we can still relate to a lot of aspects of some of the characters that the bard has so skillfully articulated. These plays deserve more than just the groans and the eye-rolls that they get.
<p>
  And not to mention the phrases we use everyday that we owe to shakespeare.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Too much of a good thing: Even good things can hurt in excess
       As You Like It, Act 4 Scene 1 </li>

  <li> Neither rhyme nor reason: Without common sense or logic
       The Comedy of Errors, Act 2 Scene 2 </li>

  <li> Own flesh and blood: Part of my family
       Hamlet, Act 1 Scene 5 </li>

  <li> It's Greek to me: It's unintelligible, I cannot understand
       Julius Caesar, Act 1 Scene 2 </li>

  <li> What's done is done: I cannot change what has happened in the past
       Macbeth, Act 3 Scene 2 </li>

  <li> All that glitters isn't gold: Things are not as good as they appear to be
       The Merchant of Venice, Act 2 Scene 7 </li>
</ol>

<h1> MOVIE REVIEW: 3 IDIOTS </h1>
<h5> It is quite rare that we come across eye opening content that touches our heart and fires our soul. 3 Idiots is not just a film, it is also a riveting truth, directed by Rajkumar Hirani and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, till date hasn't lost its lustre. The protagonists, Rancho (Aamir Khan), Farhan (R. Madhavan), and Raju (Sharman Joshi) are freshers at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and are afraid of society, so much so, that farhan was aspiring to be an engineer to please his father and raju was only doing this to help his parents out of poverty. The dean of the institute was popularly called Virus (Boman Irani) and everyone at the institute feared him deeply. Other characters that added value to this story were Pia (Kareena Kapoor Khan), Mona (Mona Singh), and Silencer (Omi Vaidya).
<p>
  The plot moves forward with the trio facing a multitude of challenges, while accepting themselves and their “IDIOT” friends for who they are and end up helping each other to achieve their highest potential. This film besides being the emotional whiplash that it is, compelled its audience to look for the very mentality that we couldn't let go off. This film focuses on our education system and shows the kind of pressure students go through on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>
  With excellent cinematography and music, this movie is packed with a myriad of sentimental incidents that were relevant in today's day and age. Like the scene where a talented student Joy, commits suicide because of the pressure he faces. They show the scene of his devastated father and the regret on his friends' faces looking at his casket. Then the scene where one of the protagonists tries to commit sucide because he just got suspended. He is saved by his friends and they show a montage of him getting better. One of the heart touching scenes is where Farhan finds the courage to tell his father that he wants to quit engineering to pursue photography. Countless other scenes are filled with humour, grief and courage that expose the audience to an amazing cinematic experience.
</p>
There is a famous story of the wind and the sun telling us that when you want a man to take off his coat you don't blow it off. You make him feel warm and he will take it off himself. Our country’s youth has suffered a huge blow when it comes to passion. Our parents have learnt a certain way where they were taught how to earn a living and lead a respectable life. The generation that came before us was hellbent on a single path of success, that is, Science, and it is only through that and staying within the lines, and limiting our greatest asset that is our mind to dream, controlling it in order to fit into the opinions of those around us that turn into the suffocating murderers of excellence. This film ends with the message that it wanted to convey all along that, all is indeed well.

<h1> BOOK REVIEW:RICH DAD POOR DAD </h1>
<h5> Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Oprah are some of the famous people that we have learnt about. They are billionaires. These people have learnt how to think out of the box, how to live life to the fullest and how to make sure that their creativity is used for innovation. We don't have people like them other than them. All of us are taught to study hard and earn money. That has always been the socially sustainable way to live but the people who aspire to do more than just that are often ridiculed and I am sure you have met a lot of people who say that rich people are monsters and that they are greedy and selfish, they don't think about society and all they do is earn money but they are never happy. The very definition of wealth for people who have a one track mind is messed up. Robert T Kiyosaki’s book Rich Dad Poor Dad which is considered the number one personal finance book for people worldwide contradicts this thinking and compels our mind which according to them is our biggest asset to think out of the box. It is quite rare for people to come across a book that appeals to everyone, that applies to everyone and that helps everyone to achieve the freedom humans desire on a social level. Financial freedom is essential, it is one of the parts of life that normal people nowadays can only dream of. We get so busy and so caught up in our jobs, on getting our degrees and other people's opinions that we forget that we were born in this world not to follow a singular path but rather create one for ourselves. This book is a beautifully crafted masterpiece that gives the message that wealth isn't just about having money, it's about having family, it's about having an open mind towards things, it's about having our own path that will make sure that we are content with our life. Wealth isn't  just money, it is knowledge, it is awareness, it is about changing the course of our reality, the reality that we were told that we need to follow, it's about creating our luck and using a mind to be everything it wants to be.
<p>
  The title of this book Rich Dad and Poor Dad is very appropriate because it talks about how Roberts' Rich Dad and Poor Dad mentality influenced his choices and decisions in life. Both of his dad's influence his thoughts about money and investing. He talks about his Poor Dad or his educated dad who has a PHD and is a teacher but his mentality about money is very poor. On the contrary his Rich Dad who was his friend Mike’s father who has the mentality of a rich person. This book is called a person's Personal Finance book for a reason because it teaches a lot about investing mindset, about how to take calculated risks and how to accumulate wealth and retire early. This book gives a commendable amount of Insight on how people get wealthy and maintain it. This book is the epitome of financial literacy and it has taught millions of people about financial independence. This book also challenges the myth that you have to earn a lot of degrees and study hard to earn a lot of income. Rather, it tells you that you don't even have to earn a very high income in order to be rich. Eagerness to learn combined with some common sense can make you millions and as ridiculous as it may sound, this is the truth of this novel which has been on the best selling list for over twenty years.

 <h1> HYPERFEMININITY </h1>
<h5> Ever since I was a little, I loved dolls, makeup, jewellery, and everything pink. As I grew up, I grew into myself, but there was a time where I mocked the things I was into when I was a teenager. I didn't openly mock girls for liking all things feminine, but I did judge them. What I didn't realise was that while I was judging them I was setting boundaries for myself. I lost that part of me, when I judged someone else for it.
<p>
  Then again, I didn't even know why I was judging them. This project has been an eye opener for me. It forced me to look at those parts of me that I lost while I was growing up. I was inevitably influenced by what was shown in movies, which used girly girls as their punching bags. This explains a lot because I used to hide the fact that I loved dressing up, doing makeup, and being generally vulnerable. Now if someone looks at me, I think their first perception would be, she loves sweatshirts, sneakers and the colour grey. My cousin once told me, “Chill out! I went through the tomboy phase too!” Now that I have done this project, I can confirm the fact that this is not a rite of passage! It shouldn't be.
</p>
<p>
My aim is to prove that hating stereotypically feminine women is simply internalized misogyny rebranded as feminism, because our society has arbitrarily created "feminine" expectations for women and then arbitrarily devalued them. Our culture has changed for the worse when it comes to embracing ourselves.
Girliness is often mistaken for passivity, shallowness, and borderline stupidity! But why? It shouldn't be this way, because that would be unfair to girls who dare to be themselves in a world that too often fails to appreciate qualities like vulnerability, kindness, their love for beauty and their colourful way of life.
</p>
<p>
Most of us treat hyperfeminine women as objects. They are devalued, insulted and even projected to sexual harrassment. Hyperfemininity shouldn't only be limited to women. A lot of guys, black trans women are non-binary people are subjected to humiliation because they dont fit in the gender construct of femininity.
Hyperfemininity is the black sheep of the gender stereotypes laid down by society, because the world does not accept differences. The general population disrespect people without even understanding their emotional depth or their vulnerability, just for the sake of it.
</p>
<p>
Hyperfemininity started as a practical need. Women had to look pretty if they wanted to survive in a patriarchal world where they were nothing more than trophy cases to collect. That is where the shallowness of hyperfemininity began, and that was like a hundred years ago and after all this time here we are, circling on the same thing again and again.
Hyperfemininity  being an exaggerated gender stereotype, still exists and it is a primal nature to alot of living, breathing people with feelings. It does get the respect and it is often misjudged, which most of the time is not the case.
</p>
Have you ever heard the phrase “boyey-boys”? No right, just boys will be boys. The main focus of this project is on hyperfemininity because that gender stereotype is the most misinterpreted one. Not only guys, but even masculine girls are treated with respect, not that there's anything wrong with it, but the fact that not only a girl but a feminine “anybody” is disrespected is just borderline unfair. This century of “woke” young adults need more information to actually wake up about what they perceive to be a small problem.
 </h5>

<h1> PRIDE 2022 </h1>
<h5> ‘Normal’ in today’s day and age is a benchmark for companionship and comradery. I think normal is relative, it's always going to be relative. I think that this world is supposed to be different. The more unfamiliar things are, the more euphoric life becomes when we discover them. Humans are meant to change and acceptance is merely a choice. When we don't accept the inevitable change that comes with time, time then thrusts it upon us.
<p>
Such is the situation of the LGBTQIA+ community, almost everywhere. After years of evolution and self discovery, we are still stuck on norms that have rightfully rusted with time. Yet somehow, humans discover a way to hate each other because of a belief that was conditioned by our elders who were themselves conditioned by theirs, and the history goes on. What we consider a loss of heritage is nothing but a mere polish to it. That polish is now called love, by a lot of people.
</p>
<p>
Most of the people out there consider the community as a threat, an abnormality, a mental illness, a sociopathic deviance and sometimes borderline evil.
My conclusion to all of this would be that people are way too fragile to accept that someone else, even though related to them, has a right to choose who he or she or they want to become. The truth about this community is that it has suffered way too much for something that isn't even up to them. I mean, who wants to live life like an outcast, and if someone who is related to you chooses that, there might actually be some meaning to it, and that according to me is what this community has been trying to preach ever since they have discovered themselves.
</p>
<p>
People were projected to injustice the moment they were denied the freedom to love according to their will. There is a long way to go and it can either end with violence like the stonewall riots did or we can choose to be peaceful and cooperative, so that we don't repeat cycles of hatred. After all, what can be wrong about a community who quite literally preaches “love is love”.

 <h1> GENDER STEREOTYPES </h1>
 <h5> The world has come a long way since the dawn of time. Generations have changed and we have become more aware and conscious of our surroundings.Basically we have evolved, but have we?
So what is gender stereotype? Simply put, a boy only likes blue and a girl only likes pink. A boy can only play with cars and girls can only play with dolls. Boys are tough and strong, while girls are sensitive and soft. I am sure you have seen this, if siblings live in the same room the girl gets the pink side, filled with stuffed animals and dolls and the boy gets the blue side with cars and comic books and video games, mmm, actually no, nobody gets video games. But the point is, have you ever witnessed a child being asked about the colour he/she likes…  what if a boy likes the colour pink, and what if he likes to try new makeup. If you are on social media, you must have seen the comment section of the guys who give makeup tutorials. For every one positive comment that values beauty, there are another 100 comments telling the guy that he isn't a guy.
<p>
  I ran a survey and from all the responses that I have received, almost all of them are similar when it comes to an opinion about gender stereotypes. From the qualitative analysis, I found that group A (age group: 15 - 20) were agreeing in the matter of condemning gender stereotypes. They were of the opinion that such stereotypes are old and restrictive. A majority of people were of the opinion that such stereotypes should be introduced to the upcoming generation, thus giving them a freedom of choice as to whether they want to follow them or not, which in my opinion is what the vendetta against these stereotypes screams. The freedom to be whoever you want to be, is what is absent when such stereotypes are introduced. All the subjects in group A were, especially women who were of the opinion that they have been in conflict with their families when it comes to fighting such stereotypes. Although I did notice that the younger generation were a little extreme in comparison to the older generation when it comes to eradicating such biases. They did not seem practical, rather too enthusiastic for the reality of society. Although being a feminist myself, I can confirm the fact that there is a thin line between feminism and Pseudo-feminism and the female subjects from Group A did seem like potential Pseudo-feminists (emphasis on the word potential).
</p>
<p>
  Then again, when we take a look at group B, we find that girls just three to four years older than them did wise up, making well-informed and innovative statements for such topics. From the qualitative analysis of Group B, I can say that this age group had a more mature perspective. When it comes to gender stereotypes, these women answered in a wider perspective, thus including all arenas of life, professional life, personal life, a more intimate level and female representation in the general population. Unlike Group A, I would split up the males from Group B because they had a more traditional perspective to this matter. They weren't exactly regressive, but I can only guess that according to them, they were being realistic. The controversial question in the survey about gender roles and stereotypes pertaining to certain professions was a little surprising because some male subjects of this group were of the opinion that some professions are more suited for men than for women and vice versa, while also maintaining a certain level of diplomacy by denying generalisation in such matters. From Statistical Analysis we can realise that the average of Group B is more than that of Group A . Also, Group B is more homogenous than Group A due to the consistency in the responses provided due to which its Coefficient of Variation is less than that of Group A.
</p>

<p>
  This project is an eye opener for breaking the myth of generalisation that the older generation is more rigid and opinionated. Nothing can be farther from the proof, from both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the survey. The younger generation is empathetic, but unrealistic, strong minded but impatient. They need a quick change in the system, and while they are willing to work for it, they are still a little blind towards how far society has come. On the other hand the older generation seems content with the change, my only conclusion to this is that they are experienced enough to actually differentiate between the conditions they faced in the past to the conditions they are now facing. Group B has a more mature perspective regarding this topic, whilst group A is more strong-willed.
</p>
<p>
  Gender stereotypes have been instilled in all of us. Yes, some people are trying to change but there is a long way to go. Changing the gender stereotype and accepting people for themselves is a tough row to hoe. But it's a gradual process. Changing our outlook cant happen overnight, we have to work upon this and accept masculinity and femininity as traits not people. Humans are allowed to be masculine and feminine, both or neither. It's up to them, because what we often mistake gender to be a biological construct, is actually a social construct, and it's high time that we change and rise above that.
